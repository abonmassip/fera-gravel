**What is it?**

The FERA Passport is a plastic sheep tag with individual numbering.
It's a way to collaborate with the FERA Pyrenees Mountain Gravel while consuming locally.

**How it works?**

Presenting this Passport to any of our collaborating partners below will allow its bearer to enjoy services and offers.
It is an individual Passport and can only be used once at each establishment.
Afterwards, you can use the sheep tag as a key ring.

**How to get it?**

There are several ways to obtain the Passport.

- With all Agency products. [OUTDOOR ADVENTOUR](https://ca.outdooradventour.com/tours/fera-pyrenees-mountain-gravel)
