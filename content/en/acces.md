# ACCESS

---

Fera Pyrenees Mountain Gravel is designed to be accessible by public transport.

Whether it is Fera or one of its various options, they all have access by train from the Ferrocarriles de Catalunya de La Pobla de Segur station and its connection with Lleida.

Obviously the route and its options can be accessed from any other point. If this is the case, we recommend some alternatives that we encourage you to consult and use.

For all those who carry out any of the Fera300, Fera200 or Fera150 routes starting or ending in Sort, we suggest a link between this point and La Pobla de Segur along the C-13 road of just over 25km (see the sections on each of the proposals).

A taxi service can be offered on demand if deemed necessary.
