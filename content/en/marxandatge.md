# MERCHANDISING

The Fera Pyrenees Mountain Gravel would not make sense without the territory where it takes place and its people.

We want to give visibility and work with friendly projects, rooted in the Pyrenees. That's why we've collaborated with some of them to create products related to cycling and the Fera Pyrenees Mountain Gravel.

We encourage you to visit their websites and buy if you feel like it. Consume local, consume territory.
