Fera Pyrenees Mountain Gravel project revolves around this route.

510 km and 13,300 m of positive ascent. Of these, 48% are dirt and 52% asphalt.

A circular route that connects the northern and southern faces of the Central Pyrenees by high mountain dirt tracks and small roads that exceed 2,000m in height.

A route that rests under the snow for several months of the year and that we recommend doing from the beginning of June to the end of October.

Designed to pedal all the landscapes, cultures and traditions of its mountains, we encourage cyclists to pedal it completely.

Although the Fera has a specific route, it has several alternatives that allow you to reduce the mileage and the difference in altitude. We recommend using them in case of adverse weather or extreme fatigue.

You can find more information in the Route section and download all the specific information about the route divided into segments in the Fera Route Book.
