# ROUTE

---

One route, many options.

Fera Pyrenees Mountain Gravel revolves around a circular route of 510 km and 13,300 m of positive elevation gain.

It rides through the Central Pyrenees between small roads, paved tracks, dirt tracks and trails. Always looking for the most pedalable route and avoiding the busiest communication routes.

We propose La Pobla de Segur as the start and end of the route, we also use the most important service centers in the area to structure and segment the route.

We also present alternatives that allow you to significantly reduce mileage and unevenness.

Each cyclist is free to pedal Fera in the stages they deem convenient and to use the necessary alternatives. Obviously it can also be started from any point on the route.

The project has more than one route to pedal in the heart of the Pyrenees, several circular route options to adapt to the needs of all cyclists.

From the 500 km route, we propose options with less mileage and different characteristics. You can consult the descriptions of all the options in the specific sections of each layout.
