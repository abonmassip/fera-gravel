# THE BIKE

---

Fera is designed to be pedaled with a gravel bike.

A gravel bike to escape specialization, as a travel and adventure bike, which allows you to progress on all types of terrain.

In any case and as is obvious, it can be done with any type of bike that is considered convenient.

To create the route we used a steel gravel bike with mixed tires, and a 50/34 chainring and 11/36 cassette ratio. Always carrying little weight.

Based on this experience, we advise:

- A chainring and cassette ratio closer to the mountain bike. It can make pedaling easier on long climbs, especially if you do the route with weight.

- Stiffer frame and fork materials on the bike can cause greater demands on long descents.

- We recommend mixed tires, although it would be possible to do it with any type.

We advise a thorough check of the bike before starting the route. The requirement of the route also affects the material. The brakes must be in optimal condition to face the long descents.
