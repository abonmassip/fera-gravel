# LA FERA

---

We created the FERA Pyrenees Mountain Gravel out of love for the territory we live in and the desire to preserve and share it. A project resulting from years of discovery and cycling that we now want to make yours.

A route with different paths and one goal: Pedaling the heart of the Pyrenees.

Different high mountain crossings with different distances and landscapes that make sense in their entirety.

A route that we want alive, in constant evolution and improvement, that commits to a tourism model that cares for the ecosystems and societies that host it. Linked to local projects, accessible by train and promoting compensation actions for the COâ‚‚ generated.

A cycling project for everyone to make it their own, committing to self-sufficiency or using accommodation options along the way, respecting regulations and the local population.

A different way to discover the Pyrenees without rushing and enjoying every pedal stroke. To ride without leaving a mark, where every cyclist becomes part of the landscape.
