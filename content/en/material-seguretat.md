# SAFETY GEAR

---

- Lights and reflective elements: FERA takes place on roads and tracks used by other vehicles, it is necessary to take all the necessary safety measures to make us visible.

**It is mandatory to use a light (front and rear) and a reflective vest to cross the Vielha Tunnel.**

- Warm clothes: FERA travels through high mountain areas where the weather is changeable and can be very adverse at any time of the year. We recommend raincoat and warm clothes.

- Repair gear: Many sections of the route are far from service centers and workshops. We recommend bringing the basic repair material.
