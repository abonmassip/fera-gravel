# FERA’S DENS

---

We want to invite you to eat local, keep the rural and mountain areas alive.

It makes us very happy to collaborate with some local projects in our valleys.
We want to thank you for believing in the project.

The FERA’s dens are establishments rooted in the territory that offer services and discounts to all those who present the FERA Passport.
