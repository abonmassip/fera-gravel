The route runs entirely through rural mountain areas. We recommend being prudent in terms of access to food and services. Some of the population centers that you pass through do not have services, or may not have them at the time of our passage, despite being described in the itineraries. The only places where we guarantee to have the most services are the start and end cores of the proposed segments.

Specifically:

- SOURCES: Usually non-potable (non-chlorinated) water. Although not common, they can be dry during the months with less precipitation.

- SHOPS / WORKSHOPS: In smaller population centers they may be open at very specific times and sometimes only in the months with the greatest influx of visitors. In some cases they may only have specific products. The workshops are located in the largest population centers. There are points with tools to make small repairs. We recommend bringing all necessary repair material.

- BARS/RESTAURANTS: Not always open in small towns. Some accommodations can provide this service.

- ACCOMMODATION: Outside of the larger population centers and campsites, it is possible to not find accommodation in the months with the greatest influx of visitors if it is not with prior reservation. Consult in time.

- EMERGENCY SHELTERS: Spaces that allow protection in the event of an emergency. We do not recommend staying overnight if it is not essential.
