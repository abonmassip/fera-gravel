The Pyrenean landscape marks its toughness. FERA is the result of the commitment to share the best itinerary that allows you to discover the diversity of the territory by avoiding the busiest roads and looking for the most rideable itineraries.

It is not a conventional gravel route, it runs on small paved roads and high mountain tracks between the mountain bike and the gravel. A route that could hardly be done comfortably with any other type of bicycle.

It should be borne in mind that FERA exceeds 2,000m of altitude in several sections and reaches over 2,400m. It circulates between the highest mountains of the Pyrenees and also through its deep valleys. A tough territory not only because of its mountains, but also because of its climate and weather conditions. Much of the route rests under snow for many winter months and in the summer you have to watch out for storms and sudden changes in temperature.
