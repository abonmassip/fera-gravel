The income generated in this concept will be allocated to the Escola de Pastors de Catalunya, a training school for shepherds in extensive and mountain livestock farming.

Extensive livestock farming stabilizes the population, creates a mosaic territory that improves biodiversity and helps reduce the possibility of large forest fires, as well as reducing the consumption of artificial fertilizers and helping to maintain carbon sinks.
