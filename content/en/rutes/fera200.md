To facilitate access to the Fera Pyrenees Mountain Gravel project, we propose dividing the main route into two circular routes, Fera 200 is one of them.

Fera 200 has 206 km and 5400 m of positive elevation gain. Of these, 53% are dirt and 47% asphalt.

It is a circular route that we propose starting in Sort, ending in La Pobla de Segur, and a link between the two towns.

Fera 200 ride through the eastern sector of the Fera Pyrenees Mountain Gravel, the southern faces of the Pyrenees mountain range.

This route rides through the heart of the Alt Pirineu natural park and its area of influence.

From the Noguera Pallaresa valley to the Segre valley passing through the summit of the route, the Torreta de la Orri, 2,438m high.

A route that rests under the snow for a few months of the year and that we recommend doing from the beginning of June to the end of October.

You can find more information in the Route section and download all the specific information about the route divided into segments in the Fera Route Book.
