nom: "Fera 150 Boumort."
---

A circular route that surrounds the Serra de Boumort and crosses the Pla de Corts.

134 km and 3,300m of positive ascent. 54% km of land and 46% of asphalt.

Small mountain roads and dirt tracks between the Noguera Pallaresa and Segre valleys. Between La Pobla de Segur, where we propose a start and finish, and Organyà.

A route that crosses the gentle landscape of the Plà de Corts and its karst lake of Montcortés through small roads before entering the dirt tracks of one of the wildest spaces in the Pyrenees: the Serra de Boumort.
An untamed landscape, not always comfortable for gravel bikes, which is worth pedaling to reach the Cuberes shelter where we recommend staying if you split the route into two days.

From the refuge, you can reach the cattle farms of Taús and the Cabó valley. A spectacular track that will require our attention will lead us to the bottom of the valley, to later reach Organyà.

From there, small paved and dirt roads will take us along the south side of the Boumort range and its rocky walls to La Pobla de Segur.

The route can be done throughout the year. However, we do not recommend doing it if there has been snowfall at low altitudes during the winter (snow can accumulate in some areas of the north face) and in case of heat waves during the summer (the south face can reach very high temperatures)

The Refugi de Cuberes, located in Casa Miró, is open from the end of March to the end of November. Reservation in advance is required. You can request information and make reservations by phone (via whatsapp) +34 619 847 866 or on their website <https://www.refugicuberes.com>
