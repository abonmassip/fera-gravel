FERA 150 are circular routes that partially follow the route of the FERA Pyrenees Mountain Gravel. They allow us to discover spaces that could not be included in the main route but that we also want to share.

Routes designed for gravel bikes where we offer accommodation in the middle point to be able to cycle in one or two days.

Obviously, they can be done with the bike, the stages and the way you want as long as the regulations of each space are respected.
