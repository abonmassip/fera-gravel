To facilitate access to the Fera Pyrenees Mountain Gravel project, we propose dividing the main route into two circular routes, the Fera 300 is one of them.

Fera 300 has 304 km and 7,900 m of positive elevation gain. 45% are dirt and 55% asphalt.

It is a circular route that we propose starting in La Pobla de Segur, ending in Sort, and a link by road between the two towns.

Fera 300 ride the western sector of Fera Pyrenees Mountain Gravel, the northern and southern faces of the Central Pyrenees. It circulates through the valleys of Noguera Ribagorçana, Garona and Noguera Pallaresa.

In this sector there are several high mountain passes that exceed 2,000m in height, large cattle mountains and valleys where forestry marks its landscape.

Fera 300 runs through protected areas of great cultural and natural interest, as the Alt Pirineu Natural Park and the Aigüestortes i Estany de St. Maurici National Park.

A route that rests under the snow for a few months of the year and that we recommend doing from the beginning of June to the end of October.

You can find more information in the Route section and download all the specific information about the route divided into segments in the Fera Route Book.
